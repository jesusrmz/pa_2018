 Mike and his friend Tom are playing a very interesting game right now. Here is the description of the game:

    * Initially, there is a positive integer N written on the desk, which is strictly greater than 1;
    * Mike makes the first move, then players make moves alternatively;
    * On each move the current player can either decrease the number on the desk by 1, or divide it by one of it's  divisors except itself and 1; It's forbidden to decrease the number if it's equal to 1;
    *If the current player can't make a move, then he loses. In other words, if there is "1" written on the desk right before his move, then he loses. 

You are given a number N. You need to determine the winner of the game, if N is the number written of the desk initially. You may assume, that both players play optimally.
